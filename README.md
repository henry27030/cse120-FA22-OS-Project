For the most part, I did the swap file implementation, but I also worked closely with Mark overall on part 2 and debugging. For the swap file, I simply used the TranslationEntry objects with a hash map to map everything out. I kept a list of free pages in the swap file, and simply added an extra page whenever we ran out of space; this should allow us to fill gaps. We all checked on each otherâ€™s work in literally every part of the project, and readVirtualMemory, writeVirtualMemory, unloadSections, and the exceptionHandler were all sort of a group effort. After writing this, Mark and I spent 2 days debugging, the vital flaw being unloadSections(). To test, we simply used the swap4, swap5, write10, and dungeon testing files.
