# UCSD CSE120 FA22 nachos starter code

- This repo contains the starter code for nachos for UCSD CSE 120 Principles of Operating Systems course for FA22 quarter.

- Please go through the README in the nachos directory for detailed information about nachos.

- Note that this code is the same as the starter code that is available as a tar file on ieng6 machines.

I worked on VMProcess, specifically loadSections, handleException, prepRequestedPage, and 
placed additional checks for the virtual page in read and write virtual memory fucntions.
Instead of loading the page in loadSections(), I saved the CoffSection number s 
in the same vpn index as its index in the pageTable.  Later in prepRequestedPage, 
which is given the argument badVPN, CoffSection[badVPN] would store s, and I 
used s to replicate the function calls to load the page within prepRequestedPage.
In prepRequestedPage, pages from the CoffSection and pages that were required to be 
zero-filled differed in the way that indexes that stored CoffSection pages stored s, 
a value greater than or equal to zero, and zero-filled pages stored -1.
In handleException, if a page fault occurred, we would call prepRequestedPage with the 
index of the page that faulted to handle the page fault.

For the most part, I did the swap file implementation, but I also worked closely with Mark overall on part 2 and debugging. For the swap file, I simply used the TranslationEntry objects with a hash map to map everything out. I kept a list of free pages in the swap file, and simply added an extra page whenever we ran out of space; this should allow us to fill gaps. We all checked on each otherâ€™s work in literally every part of the project, and readVirtualMemory, writeVirtualMemory, unloadSections, and the exceptionHandler were all sort of a group effort. After writing this, Mark and I spent 2 days debugging, the vital flaw being unloadSections(). To test, we simply used the swap4, swap5, write10, and dungeon testing files.
